        <p> The main characters of Super Mario Odyssey are: Mario (the guy with the mustache), Cappy (Mario's hat with eyes), Princess Peach and Bowser (the villain). The goal of the game is to travel across different diemensions until you reach the moon where bowser's castle is. There is also a different boss in each diemension with bowser being the final boss of the game. At the moon you need to defeat bowser thus saving Princess Peach. </p>

                <p> Super mario Oddyssey is a pretty budget game sitting at around $45 (depending on the store you get it in). Honestly it's a pretty good game and it costs the price. Thank you for your time. </p>
